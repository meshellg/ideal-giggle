A friend and I went over to the [Blue Plate Diner](http://www.blueplatediner.ca/) for a snack a couple of nights ago. It has a relatively inconspicuous location downtown, at least I've always missed it, and I know I've walked by countless times. I had been meaning to visit since I saw it listed in the VOA Dining Guide, and finally got around to doing so.  

We ordered the Indian sampler plate since it was one of the few vegan items on the menu that we could share. I really liked one of the chutneys and the pakoras were quite good, but the samosa's were way too greasy for my liking. If we do ever go to the Blue Plate Diner again, I'm going to try the Lentil & Nut loaf, because it looks interesting. Over all though I think the Blue Plate Diner is a great option for lacto-ovo vegetarians, moreso than vegans. But it is a nice downtown option open till 10pm everyday, which feels unusual, and easy to visit if you're checking out [Edmonton's City Market](http://www.city-market.ca/). But of course, if you're checking out the City Market, there are so many other options to snack on.  

Speaking of the Edmonton City Market... I keep meaning to go, maybe next week. There are two vendors I want to check out specifically, [Limegreens](http://limegreens.com/), and Fiesta Olives. They were mentioned on the Edmonton Journal's website. Limegreens looks like a decent raw vegan snack source, and Fiesta Olives... well that's pretty self explanatory. I've gotten on some kind of olive kick lately, and I'm craving a new variety of tapenade.  

And hey, Starbucks in certain Canadian locations has started carrying [Lucy's](http://www.drlucys.com/) cookies. Made without eggs milk, peanuts or tree nut and gluten free, I'll admit I didn't know what to expect. I picked up a bag of four cookies for $1.75 while in St. Albert, Alberta and it wasn't bad at all. Paired nicely with my pricy soy vanilla bean frappachino.
