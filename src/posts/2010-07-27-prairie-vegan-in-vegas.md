In a couple of days, I'm heading off to Las Vegas for a nerd conference. I've been there once before (for different reasons), and it was an experience to remember. As with most trips, I'm starting a list of things to check out, and hopefully, by being there for a week, I'll get some of these things done while still making the most of my time at the conference.

I've been given a few recommendations of places to eat, especially right on or near the strip. Last time I went to Las Vegas was in 2006, so a lot has changed, but several places are still around (which is great to see).

**Places I'd like to to eat:**
- **Ronalds Donuts ( 4600 Spring Mountain Rd. Las Vegas, NV)**

Loved this place, and have to go again! What I am really curious about, is whether my love of these donuts will have been changed by my experiences with Portland donuts (such as the ones from Sweetpea, or even the ones at Voodoo.) My last visit to Ronalds Donuts was probably the first time I had had a donut in about 5-6 years since going vegan. According to what I could find on the internet they are open Mon-Sat 4am-4pm, and Sun 4am - 2pm. **How to get there by bus:** walk southwest down the strip (towards Fashion show mall) to W Spring Mountain Rd  @ Las Vegas Blv S. Catch the RTCS 203 - Spring Mountain/Twain Westbound and get off at Spring Mountain @ Stober (W).

\- **Komol** - 953 East Sahara Avenue,  Las Vegas, NV 89104-3014  (702) 731-6542 I went to this restaurant in 2006, it's conveniently located not too far from the strip and has a number of delicious vegan and vegetarian options on the menu.

\- **Atomic #7's Organic & Vegan Ice Cream store** - 605 Mall Ring Circle #110, Henderson, NV Vegan ice cream? Need I say more? It's a bit out of the way, but maybe it'll be worth the hour long bus ride? **How to get there by bus**: The route to take from the strip according to Google Maps, is the 301 - The Duce NB (at 27 past every hour) connect to the 402 - Crosstown Connector/Boulder City SEB (on the hour) get off at Sunset @ Sunset Station (E) and walk for less than five minutes.

\- **Go Raw Cafe** Has two locations: 2381 E Windmill Lane (in Smith's Shopping Center) and 2910 Lake East Drive (in the Lakes Center) Nothing in particular was suggested, but most reviews have been favourable.

**\- [Wazuzu](http://encorelasvegas.com/) \-** 3131 Las Vegas Blvd S, 702-770-5388 Located in the Wynn on the Strip. According to the Happy Cow listing they have a separate vegan menu available, you just need to ask. I'll probably give them a call to confirm before I actually visit.

**\- [Noodles & Co](http://www.bellagio.com/restaurants/noodles.aspx)** - 3600 Las Vegas Blvd S, 702-693-7223 Located at the Ballagio, the Dim Sum was recommended as being full of vegan options. Dim Sum happens Friday's and Saturdays between 11am and 3pm.

**\-** [**California Pizza Kitchen**](http://cpk.com/) **-** Multiple Locations in the City (but the closest one on The Strip looks like 3200 Las Vegas Blvd S #1590, inside the Fashion Show mall.) This is a new to me pizza chain. They have a great [vegan guide](http://www.cpk.com/menu/pdfs/vegetarian.pdf) (pdf) on their website, and I'll have to visit them at least once to see how it is. Only the thin crust pizza and the pizza marinara, vegetarian black bean, and spicy marinara sauces are vegan.

\- [**Border Grill Las Vegas**](http://www.bordergrill.com/bg_lv/bg_lvwel.htm) - 3950 Las Vegas Blvd S Located at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, the recommendation was to get the Mushroom Mulitas (it's $21 and on the Dinner Menu). The menu is labeled with a little green circle for items that are mostly plant based, but they also mention that many items can be made with out meat or dairy on request.

**Random silly fun stuff** - [Fresh52](http://fresh52.com/Index.html)[Farmers Market](http://fresh52.com/Index.html) Every Sunday at Sansone Park Place, 9480 S. Eastern Las Vegas, NV 89123. To get there for 9am, and for simplicity sake (i.e. take as few buses as possible) it looks like the best way to get there by bus from the Rivera is to: Catch the **204 - Sahara EB** at Sahara @ Las Vegas blvd E, get off at Sarahara@ Eastern Avenue and catch the **110 - Eastern SB**. Get off the bus after approximately 35minutes at Eastern Ave@ E Richmar Ave.

**[Food not Bombs](http://foodnotbombslasvegas.org/)** Every Sun. 10:30am–12pm: Baker Park At E St Louis & 10th St, Las Vegas Every Wed. 4pm–6pm: Paradise Park 4775 McLeod Drive, Las Vegas Between Harmon and Trop. - the [Stratosphere's Rides](http://www.stratospherehotel.com/thrills/x_scream.cfm) and the [Skyjump](http://www.skyjumplasvegas.com/Availability) - Checking out KA from Cirque Du Soleli. - [The PinBall Hall of Fame](http://www.pinballmuseum.org/) - 1610 E Tropicana Ave (across the street from the Liberace Museum) The Route 201 goes from the Strip at the MGM/Escalibur will get you there, get off bus between S. Maryland and S.Eastern on Tropicana Ave. Runs between 7am and 12midnight.
