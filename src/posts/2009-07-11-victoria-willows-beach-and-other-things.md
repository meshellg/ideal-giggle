Yesterday we went to Willows Beach as a group. And I loved it. It was around 6pm, and still sunny, but not too hot. However, the water was COLD. I saw a few people jumping in, full body, and I though I could feel my own muscles cramping up in empathy.

It was a perfect evening to lay around on the beach and read or nap.

One thing that I love about the University of Victoria is their vegan food options, and the staff's willingness to ask what is in things for me. I'm the annoying person, "is there butter in this?" "what is this?" "is there dairy?" I believe they have also upped their vegan options for my visit, which goes to show, it pays to ask in advance.

I was worried once I learned I'd be eating in residence, because a limited menu for someone else, becomes an exercise in creative meal planning for me. Am I getting enough protein, vitamins, fat from the food I'm eating? Stuff I need to consider. So I emailed Food Services, and someone replied with let us know when you'll be here and we'll make sure you are taken care of. They normally have a vegan & vegetarian residence dining hall on campus. How amazing is that?

The other day I ate a flakey pastry vegan sausage roll type thing from the salad bar. And they always have soy milk availible in the mornings for my ceral. And they've started making vegetable & hummus sandwiches. hurrah.

Like obviously, it's not [Cafe Bliss keylime pie](http://meshell.ca/blog/victoria-cafe-bliss-and-green-cuisine-7509/ "Cafe Bliss Key Lime Pie"), but it's really good anyway. Anyway, I'm having a great time, and learning a lot while I'm here.
