This morning we went over to [Sadie's Diner](http://www.myspace.com/sadiesdiner)Â (504 Adelaide Street W, Toronto) for Brunch. Everyone seems to love the place, but both times I've been there, I haven't been very excited about it. Either way, it was great to hang out with old friends and new friends.  

I had the breakfast burrito and uncharacteristically only finished half of it, though I am looking forward to eating the rest of it (maybe tomorrow for breakfast.) It was a tortilla stuffed with refried beans, salsa, lettuce, soy cheese (I'm thinking it was diaya because it was melty) and their tofu scramble. On the plus side, the potatoes were totally great, and I love that there is hot sauce readily available (which went great with the burrito because it needed some spice.) I remember having an awesome smoothie there two years ago, but I skipped it this time.  

Later I went to the Eaton's Center (I need a new camera,) walked through the Art Gallery of Ontario for a few hours, walked through "The World's Largest Bookstore" (it's not really the world's largest bookstore anymore) and took in the Filipino Making Waves Festival in Younge-Dundas Square. It's great being in Toronto. My friend was telling me the one thing about being here, is that there are always ten-plus things to do on a regular basis, he's right! Next weekend the FanExpo is happening right here in Toronto, and I want to be there.  

To top it all off, my host's cooked for me. Am I spoiled or what? I came back from galivanting around downtown Toronto and African Kale Stew (made with veggies from the farmer's market) and a cob of corn slathered in earth balance margarine was waiting for me. So yummy. It was cool to taste it as per recipe instructions, because I can't follow a recipe at all, and when I made the African kale stew, I made a bunch of substitutions.  

This evening we went out for a walk on Church Street, and stopped at Adam & Eve Choclatier's (97 Maitland Street, Toronto) for some sorbetto. They have three varieties that are dairy free: lemon (my favourite,) raspberry, and mango. I got to a taste of all of them, but I always love lemon sorbetto the most, so I got that and a scoop of mango. So. Good.
