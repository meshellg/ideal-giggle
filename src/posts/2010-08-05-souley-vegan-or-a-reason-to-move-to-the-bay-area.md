I went to [Souley Vegan](http://souleyvegan.com/) in Oakland, California last night. What an amazing place to eat. The servers are super friendly, the food is ridiculously good, and I left feeling fuller than ever before, and still didn't finish everything on my plate. I was tempted to do an "after" photo to illustrate how little I ate, but it was just embarrassing.

I was waiting on a couple of other people, so I just started off with a piece of cornbread. I love cornbread. I loved this cornbread even more. It got me excited about what else I would eat. When it looked like I would be dining alone, I decided to do what I always joke about with my friends, "I'll have one of each..." So I did. The Everything Plate (+ fried okra and rice and red beans for 25$ in total) is a good option if you don't know what you're doing, and not sure what you'd like. These plates could probably feed three people. Everything was yummy, but I had a few favourites.

The fried okra was amazing. How unbelievably good. Sliced up, breaded in corn meal, and fried. Coming in second was the breaded & fried tofu. Where have you been all my life? It was so good, so salty, so satisfying.

It makes total sense that Souley Vegan would be rated as one of the top soul food places in the city (vegan or otherwise). Don't miss it! I left with two boxes of left overs, that still tasted good when I had some for breakfast this morning. I have the strong suspicion that I'll be back before I leave. I need to try the sweet potato pie... and maybe take some okra for the road.
