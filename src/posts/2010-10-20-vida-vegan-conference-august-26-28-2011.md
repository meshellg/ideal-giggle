I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be speaking at the first ever [Vida Vegan Bloggers Conference](http://vidavegancon.com/) August 2011 in Portland, OR.  There are so many awesome people on the speakers list, I'm so excited to get the chance to meet the people behind blogs I've been reading for years!  

It will be a great excuse to go back to Portland, Oregon and check out some of the [old haunts](http://blog.prairievegan.com/search/label/portland). I can't wait to have brunch at [Sweetpea Bakery](http://sweetpeabaking.com/) again and check out some of the new food carts!
