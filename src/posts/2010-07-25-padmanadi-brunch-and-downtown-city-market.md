After work this morning I hopped on the LRT, and sat at Credo Coffee with the other Early Birds waiting to swoop in on the Downtown Edmonton Farmers Market. I picked up a package of LimeGreens Sour Cream and Onion Kale Chips, and they were such a hit with the family (and pretty much everyone that's tried them.) J and I tried a cherry chocolate smoothie with hemp seeds, and it was delicious, such a nice flavour from the raw cocoa. Another beautiful day in Edmonton, and perfect for visiting the farmers market.  

We stared longly at the Eva's Sweet Waffles cart hoping that one day there would be vegan options, but it wasn't meant to be (not yet?) So instead (and preferably) it was time to try brunch at [Padmanadi](http://www.padmanadi.com/) for the first time. I've heard about it, I've longingly stared at the menu for weeks, but just never got around to going there. Luckly J was game, and off we went.  

Brunch was AMAZING. The ham and cheese omelet, with veggie ham, mushrooms, spinach and cheddar style daiya cheese, wrapped up in multiple layers of bean curd sheet. I don't think I can recommend that people try this enough. Yum.

We also tried the Traditional Eggs Benedict, with tofu egg on an English muffin, veggie salami sausage slices, tomato, and hollandaise sauce. This was pretty darn delicious, and looked beautiful, but the Ham and Cheese omelet was hard to top.

I am so glad we went to Padmanadi for Brunch, it as though it could turn into an after City Market tradition.
