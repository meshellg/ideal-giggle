I arrived in Victoria this afternoon, and it has already been great. I'm staying at [Turtle Hostel](http://www.turtlehostel.ca/) at the moment, soon to be moving on to the UVic residence tomorrow.

I spent the day just relaxing a bit, wandering around the east side of Victoria, and I already stumbled upon a few great vegan options. One that I'm really looking forward to trying is [Pizza Pi](http://www.pizzapi.ca/), it's right on Douglas Street, which on first glance appears to be saturated with little shops and restaraunts. Pizza Pi is focused on local, organic and environmentally friendly production. They have vegan cheese, and gluten free pizza crusts if need be. I'm waiting for a friend to come to town, or maybe when I'm feeling particularly hungry to order a pizza, because their smallest size consists of a 10 inch wide, 6 slice pizza.

I also stopped by a Market and found it was well stocked with organic produce, normal people food, and vegan muffins. I picked up some lemon cranberry muffins, and as I hoped, they were delicious.

Tomorrow will be an action packed day, I hope I can catch a few of the things that are going on.
