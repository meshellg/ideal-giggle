We were passing through Montreal on a road trip recently, and wanted to try something new. Our usual stop [Sushi Momo](http://meshell.ca/blog/montreal-2016-sushi-momo/) wasn't open until evening, and we wanted something we could take with us to go, so we could arrive at our next destination with the option of eating lunch.

Voila - Antidote Bouffe Végane saves the day. (that said, [I hadn't heard of the weird stuff going on behind the scenes](https://montreal.eater.com/2017/12/22/16807620/antidote-bouffe-vegan-hochelaga-elise-bellerose-arielle-lajardiniere-firing-misconduct) - hopefully they've changed the treatment of their employees for the better, because everyone there was lovely.)

Service was friendly and quick, it was also bilingual, though the menu was not. We ordered a few things from their brunch menu, and waited in a lovely front sitting area in the sunshine surrounded by plants.

I ordered the bagel au « saumon fumé tsé » which was excellent and came with hashbrown potatoes, a salad, and some fruit.

JC got the B.L.T and he really liked it too,![](images/IMG_20180811_114200-1024x768.jpg)

and our son really liked the pains dorés with apple caramel, but we didn't grab a picture of that one.

Antidote Bouffe Végane seems like a cool place to sit and eat, but we had to get rolling on to Quebec city.
