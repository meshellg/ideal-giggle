Okay, the other day, I consumed what I believe was the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. Maybe I'mÂ exaggerating, but I looked through my memory banks, at the pre-vegan days (cheesecake factory, homemade, little bistro cakes), compared it to the former Best Cheesecake Ever from Wink (which existed once upon a time in Vancouver) and still, this one is the winner.  

How can it not be, with a creamy peanut butter banana chocolate filling, and a thin layer of peanut butter on the bottom chocolatey crust.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Cheesecake from Remedy. There isn't anymore. We took the last two slices on Sunday. But if you happen to walk into Remedy one day, and see this... you should get a piece. The heck with all other cheesecakes. I want this cake for my birthday.
