My awesome amazing friends invited me over for dinner and made this delicious Seitan Piccata from Veganomicon. I've made no secret of my crazy love of olives, so having a dish with seitan, mashed potatoes covered with a tart delicious wine sauce, capers and olives was total heaven.  

The thing I realized after I ate this amazing meal is that I haven't put any effort into preparing any food since I got here in Toronto. It's been a combination of peanut butter, noodles, jam, fruit and really basic crappy things. The best meals I eat are outside of the house. Right now I'm a lazy verging on nutritionally deficient vegan, and it's time to change that.  

Yes I'll get on that, right after I check out a couple of more restaurants... (or maybe I need more friends to cook me dinner... hint hint)
