Happy first day of Vegan Mofo!

I wanted to start things off with one of my favourite childhood memories.When I was little one of my fondest morning memories is when my mom would make naleśniki (Na-leh-shniki.) Watching her make them always seemed so magical because what was once a liquid, seemed to defy gravity - clinging to the pan, changing colour, and turning into something delicious. I would sit at the kitchen table, we would listen to the CBC, we would talk, all while she made breakfast.

There would be two typical fillings, a sweetened cheese one made with quark or some kind of stewed fruit or jam. My favourite of course, would be one with fruit, so that's what I made this morning, finally, for my own family.  When my mom made it, it was topped off with a vanilla sugar thick cream - this morning I made a quick cream with maple syrup, coconut yogurt, and some vanilla bean.

Before I went vegan, she would use a piece of bacon to grease the pan,  but eventually, once I went vegan she would still make ones for me with oil, filled with fruit, and dusted with icing sugar. Lucky me!

Smacznego! (which means bon appetit! or enjoy your meal!)

## Naleśniki - Polish Crepes

Makes 8 naleśniki
 
**Ingredients**

- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 2 tsps prepared Bob's Red Mill egg replacer mix
- 1 cup unsweeteend soymilk
- 3/4 cup boiling water
- a pinch of salt
- 3 tsp a light vegetable oil (I used canola)
- Filling; stewed fruit or your favourite jam
- Topping:
    - 1 cup of your favourite non-dairy yogurt
    - 1 tbsp maple syrup
    - half of the inside of a vanilla bean or a splash of vanilla extract

Pre-heat a large pan on medium heat.

Mix all ingredients together in a blender - and blend for 30 seconds on high - and then it's showtime.

Measure out 1/3 cup of your batter, pick up your pan with one hand, and get ready to pour and rotate as quickly as you can.  I used a 1/3 cup measure to pour batter onto the pan - it will be ready to flip after about a minute. Batter will curl at the edges and look slightly dry.

Flip it, and after another minute remove from pan and place on a plate. Cover plate with another plate and repeat until you have no batter left - should make approximately 8 pan sized naleśnik.

Now the filling, so, honestly, I wanted to make a sweet cheese filling with some silken tofu - but the one I bought yesterday looked like it had been frozen, which wouldn't have had the texture I was looking for, so I shifted gears and used a jar of plum jam my mom had sent me a few months ago. It was perfect, but any stewed fruit or jarred jam will do - apple, plum, apricot, pick your favourite!
