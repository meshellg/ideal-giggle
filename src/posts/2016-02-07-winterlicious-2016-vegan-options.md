Winterlicious happens every year in Toronto and is a great way to get out there during the colder months and try a new restaurant with a fixed price menu for lunch or dinner. Of the 200 participating restaurants this year, four offer 3 courses of vegan items for either lunch or dinner and one offers a vegan menu for both.

I do like that Winterlicious offers a vegan filter on their site, but I do not really care about seeing the other menu items, since I have no interest in eating them. And of course, comparing a fruit plate with a fancy multistage dessert is always a bummer, so why not just not even look at it.

I put together this list last year, and people seemed to find the whole endeavor helpful, so here is my attempt for Winterlicious 2016. Winterlicious has been on since January 29th, so there aren't many days of Winterlicious left - it ends on February 11th, so get out there!

Avoid disappointment and do confirm with the restaurant that they are still offering these things -  you can find information about all of these places and their current listings on the [Winterlicious site](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=4ac8df3d56182410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vegan=on).

I've ordered these in order of most exciting menu to least exciting, but of course, if you like salad or sorbet, then maybe the others will be your jam.
