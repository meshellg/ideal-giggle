I am finally at the UVic residence, relaxing after a long bus ride to campus from downtown Victoria. The rooms are big in my opinion, though they are lacking a sink. (at least in the Shirley Baker residence)

I unpacked and wandered around for a bit, enjoying the surroundings and the coupious amounts of bunnies everywhere. They are all (mostly) feral, but I have to resist the urge to pet them. They are terribly cute.

I went to [Cafe Bliss](http://www.cafebliss.ca/) (556 Pandora Ave, Victoria BC) recently and was not disappointed. It is right next to Mo:Le, another restaraunt I want to check out for breakfast one day, they have a Tofu scramble on the menu, but Mo:Le is not entirely vegetarian. Back to Cafe Bliss... my favourite item was the raw vegan keylime pie. Can I say wow? The texture of the crust was absolutely perfect, I believe it was a combination of almonds and figpaste, but honestly I inhaled that pie a bit to quickly to fully appreciate each ingredient. Oops. The tartness of the limes was balanced well with the sweetness of the agave which seemed like their sweetener of choice, however they do use honey in some of their foods.

I also tried some warm "hot" mint chocolate, and it was nice but I'm not really into the flavour of raw cocoa or maybe the mint was just too strong. But it was still chocolatey and delicious.

While wandering around [Market Square](http://www.marketsquare.ca/) I stumbled upon [Green Cuisine](http://www.greencuisine.com/) (#5 - 560 Johnson St, Victoria BC.) It was really serendipitous; I had no idea it was in Market Square. Earlier that day a friend had said, check out Market Square, it's beautiful and it has so many nice little shops, so I thought, okay why not. And while I was admiring the layout of the center, there it was... Green Cuisine. Of course I had to go in, because seeing it reminded me I was hungry...

I resisted the urge to have a supper composed solely of dessert items, though I have to admit, it was hard. I tried their curried coconut squash soup with two slices of corn bread, and had a piece of chocolate tofu swirl cheesecake. I was interested in the corn bread, because it tends to be too dry whenever I get it at a vegan restaraunt, this time was an exception to the norm and the cornbread was appropriately moist (but still had a good solid consistency.)

Normally Green Cuisine is a pay by weight buffet, but the soup and cornbread are charged differently (it wasn't too expensive.)
