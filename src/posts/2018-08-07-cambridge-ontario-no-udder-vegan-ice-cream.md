We visited Cambridge and Guelph last month and it was a lovely little drive and visit - I'm not sure how we ended up at No Udder in Cambridge, but I'm glad we did.

No Udder has been open since the beginning of June, and is a dairy-ice ice cream parlour with nut-free and gluten-free options. They're in the front space of Nature's Vibe, a health food and alternative health type space - but follow different hours. There was a nice variety of flavours, and the very friendly folks inside offered samples of all of them without hesitation.

The three of us sampled a little of everything, but when I saw lemon and lavender on the list, I knew I'd be getting them - sample or no sample. The lemon had the most perfect flecks of lemon zest - it was the real deal in every way.

Have you tried No Udder yet? (If you've ever had the ice cream from [Fairly Frosted bakery](http://www.fairlyfrosted.com/) at markets and VegFests around the province, you might have already enjoyed some!)
