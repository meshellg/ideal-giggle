I did not come to Toronto for FanExpo, but it just happens to be serendipitously going on while I'm here. I waited in line for about an hour and a half to get a ticket for me and a friend. I had a wonderful time once I got in there, but there are few things I hate more than standing in lines. It was very cool to see Adam West, Felicia Day and Julie Newmar in the flesh though, I walked by as they were signing autographs yesterday.

It's such an interesting crowd, especially with so many different (somewhat) nerdy past times in one space. We went again today, but the lines were so ridiculous we ended up getting frustrated and went home. It was a true case of not being angry, just disappointed.

Yesterday I went to [Poutini's](http://www.poutini.com/) (1112 Queen Street W) for Vegan Poutine! The poutine is made with white daiya cheese and a mushroom gravy, and dark fries. They even have a gluten free gravy. I walked in there and they were blaring some rap and eventually this dubstep remix. Vegan poutine and rap/dubstep meant I was extremely happy. They are cash only, so that was a little inconvenient but there was a bank machine with a nice old service fee(1.75) available in the front. I'm planning on heading back there before I leave, next time I'll try the "layered" one, it's a bit more expensive but involves more cheese.

I was meeting up with someone from Toronto and she brought me some vegan peanut butter cookies, and they were yummy, so I wanted to share the recipe from [Compassion over Killing](http://www.cok.net/lit/recipes/desserts.php#peanutcookie). They call them Peanut Cookie Brittle, but really they should just be called brittle peanut cookies! I'm going to make them whenever I have a kitchen to myself again.

This morning before FanExpo Day 2 we went to Sadie's for breakfast. I just keep coming back, but this time I was really happy with my order. Vegan French Toast with a side of veggie sausage. It was delicious, crispy deep fried breakfast sausage, with a lightly sweet cinnamon French toast. It wasn't made with French bread, but seemed like regular toasting bread. I put a little bit of dark maple on it and it was perfect.

My friend with a small appetite ordered a giant plate of chocolate chip buckwheat pancakes, so I tried a bit of them, they were good, but I was really happy with my French toast. I think I've found the thing to order if I end up there again (which seems likely.) Though today even the breakfast burrito looked really good. Maybe it's just a matter of getting the right cook.

We topped off breakfast by splitting a piece of chocolate cheesecake, first bite I wasn't a big fan, but it grew on me as I ate. Though I probably wouldn't order it again. I miss the one from Remedy in Edmonton. In all of my travels, I still haven't encountered one quite as good as that one.
