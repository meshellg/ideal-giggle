This is a simple but comforting dish that I grew up eating very often. The nostalgia of this dish is extremely high, and for very little effort you can have a hearty side dish to pump up your lunch or dinner. I've appreciated cauliflower steaks before they were a thing.It's called kalafior (Ka-la-f'your) z bułką tartą, which is basically cauliflower with a shredded bun, or in our case, cauliflower with breadcrumbs.

All you have to do is steam a cauliflower in a pot - drain it, and add margarine with fried bread crumbs on top. Voila, you're done.  My mom would make it all in one pot and it was just so cozy and comforting. Now you can have a taste of my youth in your very own home.

It's October, which is prime cauliflower season (or anytime during fall) so get a cauliflower while the prices are excellent and try this easy dish out.

**Ingredients:** 1 head of cauliflower Your favourite margarine or flavourful oil 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs 1 tsp fresh or frozen dill, chopped (optional)

**Directions** Steam the cauliflower until tender - around 8-9 minutes.

Remove and place on a serving dish. In a frying pan, add oil or margarine and set to medium, add in the breadcrumbs and fry until crumbs are golden brown.

Pour the contents of your frying pan over your cauliflower, top with dill if you want to, and serve while it's toasty.

_Smacznego!_
