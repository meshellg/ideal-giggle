I'm excited about participating in Vegan MoFo this year, as it will be my... 5 or 6th year participating(?) Maybe more, I don't know. It's hard to believe I've had this blog or some iteration of this blog for nearly a decade (okay, I started Prairie Vegan in 2007, so there is still a few years left, darn honesty.) When I'm prowling around on Vegan MoFo Participating blogs, I always like getting to know some of the bloggers participating, especially if I've never read their stuff before, and enjoy when folks put up an intro post, so here I am doing it.

I'm MeShell (I've been using that name since high school, so it's stuck, but no, my parents didn't ever write it like that), I live in Toronto, with my lovely partner JC, and our 3 cats (plus a nephew-cat,) I've been vegan since somewhere in the late 90's, and I'm originally from Edmonton. A few months ago my partner and I opened up an online vegan grocery store called the [V Word Market](http://www.vwordmarket.com), and it's been keeping us pretty busy, and people have been pretty excited - which is exciting! Most of the time you can find me on instagram @VeganInYourCity, where I share pictures of  food, cats, and art I see around whatever city I'm in at the time (usually Toronto.)

Tomorrow's [Prompt](http://www.veganmofo.com/mofo2015-sign-ups-badges-banners/) is "**Rise and Shine! It’s MoFo time! Tell us about your breakfast.**" Which is fun, because I'm actually terrible at eating breakfast - but I have been trying to get better at it over the last few lifetimes. Still not great at it. But I'll tell you all about my shitty breakfast tomorrow. (P.S. I swear occasionally, but not often.)
