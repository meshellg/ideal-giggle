A friend and I went to Bliss Baked Goods (14208 118 Ave Edmonton, AB) yesterday morning. I was extremely excited at the prospect of vegan croissants or even just a meal at this dairy-free kosher bakery. I heard about it from the VOA dining guide a while ago and wanted to try it out ever since.

Eventually I'd like to pre-ordering 6 vegan croissants (if they still make them) but not any time soon.  

After the sadness of another day without vegan croissants passed, we went to Whyte Avenue in search of some new good food. Cafe Beirut was new to us, another place for quick cheap Lebanese cuisine. Which is good to know, because I had a terrible experience at Sabzy, one of the other places for hummus, tabbouleh, etc on Whyte. There are very few times I have left a restaurant because the service was so bad, that was one of those times.  

We ordered the Falafel Platter, and it was good, but the consensus was that it wasn't spectacular. Though for what it was, let's just say it was great. The service was friendly, it was prepared quickly, and presented nicely. Next time I'm in there I'll try the baba ganouji. I was interested to read that the owner of Cafe Beirut once upon a time owned the Veggie House in St. Albert (a restaurant that is no more.) I remember making the trek over there in 2004 or 2005, one of few vegetarian restaurants in Edmonton and the surrounding area at the time.  

Afterwards we went to a place that nearly never disappoints (except when there isn't any vegan cheesecake.) So here we were at Remedy, for the first time that day. No cheesecake yet. We leave and come back after a few hours. Upon parking, that familiar delicious smell of spices cooking fills the air outside, and I'm filled with hope that the Chef is there, and with him, the magic that is his delicious cheesecake. And there it was, my favourite, the [Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana](http://blog.prairievegan.com/2010/06/best-cheesecake-ever.html). "When food is love" is embodied by this dessert. It's like eating a hug.
