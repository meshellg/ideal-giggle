You've probably seen one or two of these new [So Delicious](http://sodeliciousdairyfree.ca/) Cashew based ice creams appear around the city. If not - they're popping up everywhere - check the fridge at your local grocery. So, last week I received a box of three So Delicious Cashew Ice Creams (or, sure,  CFIA, "non-dairy frozen desserts") -  Creamy Cashew, Salted Caramel Cluster, and Dark Chocolate Truffle. And two of the new-to-Canada CocoWhips.

The package was [hand delivered by a courier](https://instagram.com/p/4YaCs7zUHt/?taken-by=veganinyourcity), and contained dry ice and branded So Delicious gloves - for safety, of course, and my own personal joy - they may or may not also be perfect for gardening. Anyway. I tell you this because it was an exciting package to receive, and to let you know that I'm already a fan of many of the So Delicious products, and to disclose any potential biases I have. You decide!

[I've tried and reviewed the CocoWhips before](http://meshell.ca/blog/lazy-vegan-friday-so-delicious-cocowhip/), while I was in the USA, so for now, I'm going to focus on the ice cream for this post - however, I do want to see if there are any difference between the countries and products (since those kinds of variations really interest me.)

## On to the Ice Cream

**Dark Chocolate Truffle**

I expected to love this one, but I didn't. It might not have been at it's best, flavour-wise it was delicious - as ribbons of dark chocolate in chocolate ice cream will be, but texturally, was tougher to dig into, and not as pleasant as the others. Despite sitting in the same freezer for the same period of time, it seemed to be either really solid, or melty. That said, I will likely try it again.

**Creamy Cashew**

This was a pleasant surprise. I expected this to be my least favourite, and I expected it to be boring - but I was totally wrong. What I ended up with was a robust creamy cashew flavour, with a touch of vanilla. Smooth. So smooth. It's so much more.

**Salted Caramel Cluster**

This was my favourite one. It was beautiful from the moment I opened the paper wrapping under the lid - creamy looking ice cream, with dark chocolate cashew chunks, and wisps of salted caramel. Yes. Yes I would like this. I got out my trusty ice cream spoon and took the first scoop and put it directly in my mouth. And it was everything I hoped for and more. It's gone now.

You might be interested to know that in the USA there are two more flavours available of the So Delicious Cashew Ice Cream - **Snickerdoodle** and **Cappuccino**. (though both have been spotted at a few markets in Toronto where they regularly seem to import things specially from the USA) The Snickerdoodle is especially delicious, but really, how can you go wrong with bits of cinnamon sugar cookie dough in an ice cream?

_Disclosure_: As I mentioned - So Delicious sent me these ice creams to try for free. But in the interest of further full disclosure, I also bought pints before and after eating the complimentary ones. I have and will buy these on my own.

## Giveaway

The kind folks over at So Delicious also sent me two coupons for a free So Delicious product. I debated keeping for myself, but I want to share the wealth.
