I've been getting into making meals in advance for the last few months, but haven't really been sticking too it too intently, I've mentioned Things2Eat a lot, but it's helped me learn how to cook more regularly - and making sure we have all the ingredients for recipes helps.

So mostly following along with the [October 7th plan,](https://www.things2eat.ca/single-post/2018/10/05/Seasonal-Vegan-Meal-Plan-for-October-7) Here we go:

I've decided to make four out of the five items:

- - [Fall Harvest Bowls](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/fall-harvest-spinach-salad/) from Eating Bird Food
    - [Aloo Gobi](https://jessicainthekitchen.com/cauliflower-and-potato-curry-aloo-gobi-masala/) (with bonus chickpeas) from Jessica in the Kitchen (which is turning into one of my favourite food blogs)
    - Thai curry pumpkin soup based on this recipe from [Running on Real Food](https://runningonrealfood.com/curried-roasted-butternut-squash-soup/) (with bonus chickpeas)
    - [Cajun Cauliflower Bowl](http://thevegan8.com/2018/09/13/cajun-cauliflower-bowl/) (but I made it with lots of vegetable oil), skipping the green beans, and adding shredded shawarma spiced [chickwheat](https://avocadosandales.com/2017/12/17/chickwheat-shreds/).

Today I've made/prepped:

- Pumpkin carrot muffins (a few with chocolate chips.)
- Thai spiced pureed roasted pumpkin coconut soup with chickpeas
- chickpea, cauliflower and potato curry.
- tahini apple cider dressing for fall harvest bowls
- Couscous (for harvest bowls (in lieu of quinoa) and cajun cauliflower bowls)
- roasted butternut squash (for lunchtime harvest bowls)
- washed and dried kale for fall harvest bowls
- shawarma-spiced chick wheat (for cajun cauliflower bowls)
- lime tahini dressing for Cajun Cauliflower Bowl
- chickwheat with 1/2tsp allspice, 1/2tsp cinnamon, and 1/2tsp nutmeg

I suspect the plan will be to order delivery one day this week, or to make tacos (as I made sure to have all the necessary ingredients on hand for those for easy lunches.)

Last week I roasted a couple of pie pumpkins, and while trying to clean out the fridge today, I decided to use all of the leftovers. The pumpkin soup is going to be great, and I'm definitely tempted to cut one of my remaining tiny pumpkins in half (and roast them) for pumpkin soup bowls that are a little bit extra this week. Only time will tell on that one.

My pumpkin carrot muffins turned out wonderfully.  I loosely followed this recipe from Lovely Little Kitchen with several modifications, including technique for minimizing bowls (which you can follow or not), otherwise two bowls, one with dry, and one with wet ingredients would work well.

## Chocolate Chip Carrot Pumpkin Muffins

![](images/muffins-min-1024x576.jpg)

#### INGREDIENTS

- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 tbsp prepared egg replacer (I used bob's red mill)
- 1 cup pumpkin puree
- 1/2 cup finely shredded carrot (approximately 1 large carrot)
- 1/2 cup light oil, I used canola
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
- 1 3/4 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and grease your muffin tin. I used a 6 muffin tin. You could also use a regular pan, just adjust the time according to your oven.
2. Mix together the wet ingredients (pumpkin, carrots, oil, vanilla), egg replacer, spices, salt, baking powder, and sugars.
3. Add flour and just stir until everything is incorporated. add chocolate chips and give batter a swirl.
4. I used a 1/2 cup measure for the large muffins - aim for them to be nearly full, they'll puff up a little bit.
5. Bake your muffins for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of a muffin comes out clean.
