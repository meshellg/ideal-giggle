In the last few days, I've made three different types of pancakes. On Friday, our son asked for pancakes for breakfast, so I made a few.

One of our favourite recipes for regular pancakes is the "Perfect Pancakes" from Isa Chandra Moskowitz's [Vegan Brunch](https://amzn.to/2CGfjuo). After finding it online a few times, we eventually had to pick it up, as it's full of wonderful ideas for breakfast. These pancakes are fool proof, straightforward, and I suspect anyone can make them and have them turn out incredible.

Since I was making pancakes anyway, I decided it was the perfect time to make potato pancakes while I was at it. So I grated a few potatoes, rinsed and pressed them to reduce moisture, and put them in a bowl.

One of the things I like to do with potatoes for pancakes is to grate them in two different ways - because potatoes are great at binding themselves together (heyo starch) - so I use the biggest side on a box grater for three potatoes and then the finest side for one.

Then I add about 1/4-1/2 cup of chickpea flour, salt, pepper, and a touch of garlic or onion powder - followed by a 1/8 of a cup of the pancake batter put into a hot pan. And voila, we're in potato pancake town.

I have been reading No Kimchi For Me by Aram Kim to our son quite often lately, and at the back of the book there is a recipe for kimchi pancakes - so after seeing this recipe fort the past few weeks, I had to make it. But obviously I omitted the egg (and didn't replace it with anything). And it was amazing.
