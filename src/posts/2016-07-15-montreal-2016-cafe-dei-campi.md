One of my favourite surprise finds in Montreal was Café Dei Campi. It was one of those times instagram really paid off and connections were helpful. I posted a picture from [Cafe Venosa](http://meshell.ca/blog/montreal-cafe-venosa/) (a vegan cat cafe) and a friend tagged one of their friends ([@odilejp](https://www.instagram.com/odilejp/) on IG who also happens to write a great vegan food blog in Montreal called [La Végane D'à Côté](https://laveganedacote.wordpress.com/).)

It was our last few hours in Montreal, and we really wanted to check this spot out, so a quick hotel check out, we jumped into a car2go, and drove out to Café Dei Campi. It's in a totally unassuming location in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie neighbourhood, in an industrialish block. But there is was Café Dei Campi. We were enthusiastically early, and they weren't open yet, but I paced back and forth until they did.

The Vegan Word wasn't around anywhere, but all of the homemade baked goods and treats are vegan. They had beautiful chocolate-filled cornettos, apple tarts, pizzettes on the way, and other things coming out warm and cozy (come early, enjoy warm baked goods - my favourite.)

You can choose between almond milk or soy milk for your coffee, and the latte we had was magical.

We're going back to Montreal again soon and I'm very much looking forward to going back there again soon.
