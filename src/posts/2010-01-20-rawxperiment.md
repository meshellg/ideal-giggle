So this past weekend I didn't cook anything. I depended on my high powered blender and not much else. So what did I end up eating, a lot of spinach soup (since I have a 1kg bag I need to use up before it gets yucky,) an avocado gazpacho, lot's of bananas, 5 different kind of oranges, apples, and stuffed tomatoes.

The stuffed tomato idea is what I think I'll be bringing to a potluck that's happening on Wednesday, just with a few modifications. (I think some added nuts and maybe some sprouts or something would be perfect.)
