I recently spotted [O'Sole Mio](https://www.osolemio.ca) Vegan Tortellini, Rosee, and Alfredo sauce while placing an online grocery order from Metro. O'Sole Mio is a family owned company started in the 90's based in Quebec that makes a variety of fresh pastas and frozen entrees - they currently have four new vegan offerings, and we've tried three of them so far. Here are the packages, the nutritional information as of 07/14/2021, and some of our thoughts on each.

One of the first things I noticed and appreciated was that all of their sauces and pastas could be frozen. I love anything I can stick in the freezer in case we don't get to it before they expire. Having a few vegan sauces or entrees stored away on days we don't feel like preparing something ourselves or ordering takeout/delivery a nice option to have.

## Plant-Based Tortellini - Beefless

The first item we tried was the beefless vegan tortellini - it's a generous package of 550g, and it fed 2 large appetite adults, with leftovers for later. I paired the tortellini with a [pomodoro pasta sauce from Buca](https://thegoodgrocer.ca/products/buca-toronto-pomodoro-pasta-sauce-750ml), but I think they would also be lovely with a bit of olive oil or vegan butter. They also have a recipe for [Vegan Cheese Tortellini with vegetables](https://www.osolemio.ca/recipes/vegan-cheese-tortellini-with-vegetables/), but I suspect it would be delicious with the beefless as well.

Ultimately this was very delicious and something I have already bought again. Price point (at least here in Toronto) is slightly more ($1.76 /100g vs $1.65 /100g) than non-vegan fresh tortellini, but does not feel outrageous. The packaging is made of number 7 plastic, is not generally recyclable anywhere, and that is a consideration for us when choosing what to buy. I'd love more sustainable options, however at the moment number 7 plastic is often used for packaged fresh pasta in grocery stores.

**Ingredients**: pasta (durum wheat semolina, water, flour, annatto powder), filling (water, textured wheat protein (wheat gluten, wheat flour, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium carbonate, vitamin e (mixed tocopherols)), toasted wheat crumbs, onion, canola oil, carrot, celery, garlic, salt, flavouring preparation (maltodextrin, yeast extract, salt, onion powder, natural flavours), red wine, herbs, spices, caramel colour). **contains: wheat**

#### Preparation Instructions (from the package):

1. Bring Salted Water to Boil
2. Add pasta, stir gently, and drain (5-7 minutes)
3. Serve immediately with your favourite sauce.

 Cook until internal temperature reaches 72 degrees Celsius.

**Notes on preparation:** I'd recommend you use your judgement on preparing the pasta - I know some people try to follow package instructions to the letter, but I had the pasta going with some gentle stirring for more than 8 minutes and some of the tortellini were not entirely cooked through, 10-12 minutes would likely make more sense..

We'll try the sauces another time.

I am bringing back Lazy Vegan Friday's - if only because I find myself posting about new-to-me vegan packaged products on instagram, and no where else.
