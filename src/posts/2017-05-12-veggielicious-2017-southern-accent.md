Once upon a time Southern Accent used to be in Mirvish Village, and we'd walk by and always plan to go in. They had a lovely and inviting patio outside, but we never got our act together and Mirvish Village is turning into a condo complex. We were worried we wouldn't get to try the food at Southern Accent, but thankfully they've moved over to College and Ossington(ish.)

I have a real fondness for New Orleans and Creole cuisine. JC and I went on a tiny south-western US roadtrip a few years ago - and it was incredible driving through Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and then ending up in New Orleans, Louisiana for New Years Eve way back when. We ate well. We had a great time. There were so many vegan options right on the menu in the French Quarter and around the city, you'd be pleasantly surprised if you've never been before. So I was missing that flavour, that ambiance, that music, the colours, the sounds.

Well, lucky us - we've got a taste of N'awlins right here in Toronto. And double lucky us, Southern Accent was participating in [Veggielicious](http://www.veggielicious.ca/) this year. They have a few vegan options on their menu year-round, but they had a couple of special dishes for Veggielicious on the go as well, so we picked the specials - planning to return again in the future for some of their regular menu items.

### The Southern Accent Veggielicious Menu

**Third Course:**

- Vegan Pavlova with fresh fruits OR
- Praline Brownie (gf) (they did not have this when we went)

I started with the Soup of the Day which was a smoky corn soup and JC had the avocado bruschetta, and goodness they were both so damn good.

Just a bite of that grilled baguette was lovely - but then they topped it off with a tasty bruschetta with a few diced avocado pieces in it.

For my main I went with the Vegetarian Basket - which had blackened assorted vegetables and tofu in a crispy phyllo pastry basket. It was full of salty smoky flavour, the veggies were perfectly cooked while still maintaining that satisfying firmness. And some tofu fingers. So good.

JC got the Vegan Jambalaya, of which I stole two spoonfuls immediately. The jambalaya was well seasoned and cooked to perfection and presented in a nice pyramid, which made it easier to steal from his plate. It was topped with a healthy helping of tofu cubes and surrounded by stir fried greens.

For dessert we each got Vegan Pavlovas, which I was very curious about. A pavlova is usually a meringue-based dessert with a crisp crust, and is usually paired with fruit and whipped cream.

They did it! I'm guessing they used the power of aquafaba (bean-water, usually chickpeas) for this one, and I'm thankful for it. Goodness knows I still haven't made anything with aquafaba, so I'm always glad to eat it somewhere else.

We had a great time at Southern Accent and will be sure to check them out again. Service was helpful, but we were mostly left on our own to chat and enjoy the atmosphere and the collection of motley artwork and New Orleans kitsch on the walls while eating delicious food. Great all around.

Veggielicious is on until May 21, 2017, and is a great opportunity to share a prix-fixe menu or try a plant-based offering in the greater toronto area. There are several different participating restaurants around the city with lots of great options. Check out the whole list over at the [Veggielicious list of menus](http://www.veggielicious.ca/2017-menu-participating-restaurants/).
