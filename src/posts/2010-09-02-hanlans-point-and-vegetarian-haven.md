Well, it was another beautiful day in Toronto, and the perfect day to go to the beach. So a friend and I took the ferry over to Hanlan's Point, which is this great little area where you can surround yourself with greenery. Unusual signs like [Please Walk on the Grass](http://www.flickr.com/photos/prairiev/4950410060/ "Please Walk on the Grass by MeShellG, on Flickr")

It was so unusual, I felt like I had to snap a picture of it. I've gotten so accustomed to seeing KEEP OUT, STAY OFF, BE KIND, BE COURTEOUS, DON'T, etc, that being invited to do something was nice.  

Hanlan's Point is also were one of Canada's two clothing optional beaches is. Both times I've been there have been fun, but it's way more fun going with a friend. Plus as she very accurately mentioned... it's nice not to have to carry around a wet swim suit afterwards. I had a super fun time swimming and napping on the side of the water. But I have to admit, initially it is a bit awkward for me to start removing clothing outside, eventually I have to remind myself... most people there just don't give a damn what I look like.  

After the clothing optional beach fun we headed back into the city, where I met up with another friend for dinner. It was time to visit the restaurant that everyone has been telling me about. [Vegetarian Haven.](http://www.vegetarianhaven.com/site/) (17 Baldwin St, Toronto.) It's a nice little bistro right next to the [Toronto Vegetarian Association](http://www.veg.ca/) and you can pick up Vegetarian Guides for Toronto at the restaurant as well.  

We ordered two appetizers, my friend ordered Tofu Drumsticks, because it's his favourite. I've never been that crazy about drumsticks, but these were great, moist, and flavourful. PLUS I could eat the sticks, since they were made out of sugarcane! Yum!  

I ordered the crispy oyster mushrooms, because if there is one thing I've learned from going out to eat, is that deep fried mushrooms are nearly universally delicious. This time was no exception, but maybe in that it was beyond delicious. The slight spice of the paprika (I thought it might be cayenne but it would have been far spicier) and the dichotomous textures, crispy batter covering the soft spongy salty mushroom. Oh and the sweet plum sauce! Everything complimented everything else.  

Then came the entrees. I ordered the Chef's Bistro Special, which was a baked tofu scramble stuffed tomato, some fried noodles, one of the tofu drumsticks and a salad that was actually enjoyable to eat.  

My friend ordered the Singapore Seitan cooked in a sweet and spicy pineapple peanut sauce. There was purple rice on the side and a few veggies. I enjoyed the peanut pineapple sauce, but the seitan had me wondering what it was seasoned with. It almost had lavender like qualities to it. I think I liked it, but I'm still not sure.  

Then as we packed up parts of the entrees that we just couldn't finish and it was time for dessert, since there is always room for it. We shared the Vanilla Cheesecake and the Chocolate fudge cake, but I probably ate the majority of both.  

There is a plus side to going places with a slow and meager eater, and a minus. On the plus side, I liked his Vanilla cheesecake more, and he couldn't finish it. So, in my mouth it went. But I had to take at least half of the chocolate fudge cake with me. They were both really rich.  

The chocolate fudge cake was very powerfully chocolaty, but a touch on the dry side, so I put a layer of better pecan ice cream on it, which soaked in with delicious results.
