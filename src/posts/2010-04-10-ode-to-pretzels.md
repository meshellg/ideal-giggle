I love soft pretzels. Those commercially available SuperPretzels burrowed their way into my heart when I was working at a hospital years ago and the only vegan option was either that, or some lettuce (and I'm not even kidding.)

When I went to Denver for the first time in 2006 I realized in one quick sweeping generalization that Americans Love Pretzels. Okay, maybe that's not entirely accurate, but there was a pretzel cart, store, etc everywhere I went. Some sort of pretzel love I'd never seen before, especially not anywhere in Canada.

New York City was also especially great for fresh hot pretzel. Carts on every other street corner. All subsequent trips to the United States meant more soft pretzels, all over New York City, Arizona, random places in Seattle, Portland. They were there. And they made me happy.  

Saskatoon is not the place to go if you like commercially available fresh soft pretzels. Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but I haven't seen them anywhere. So following the logical course of action... I baked some...  and they were fantastic. I will try again sometime.

I'm excitedly plotting my dish for the Raw Food Potluck on Wednesday, it's not going to be anything fancy. My first priority is that it's tasty and simple.
