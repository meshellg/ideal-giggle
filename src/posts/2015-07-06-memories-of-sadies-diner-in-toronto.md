We ate our last meal at [Sadie's Diner](http://www.sadiesdiner.com/) last weekend. Sadies is was a vegan-friendly meatless restaurant that had been open since 2006, but now it's closed. I've always seen it as an institution in Toronto and was a little surprised it wasn't open even longer, but it probably helps that I have never known a Toronto without Sadie's.

Sadie's Diner was one of the first vegan-friendly restaurants I went to in Toronto on my first 48hr visit to Toronto back in 2008, and was one of the first spots I visited when I arrived in 2010 (on the post-university "visit" that has extended to the present.)

Known for their all-day-breakfasts, bright teal diner tables, and a huge wall of Pez (the owner Al is a serious collector), this spot did more than serve food - it was home to fundraisers, and art shows and community meetings, and more, and I hope that there will be other local vegan businesses that pick up the torch on the Vegan-Food-For-Charity front, because that level of thoughtfulness and community involvement will be missed.

I remember [the very first Chili-For-Charity fundraiser I attended](http://meshell.ca/blog/animal-ark-ii-fundraiser-all-you-can-eat-chili-great-org-great-people-great-food/) (which was also the first time JC and I went to Sadie's together) back in April 2011 - for [ARK II](http://ark-ii.com/index.php/en/), an organization I've since joined as a director. It was my first time meeting the folks involved with ARKII and learning more about what they do. I even won a wallet and a t-shirt from the raffle.

Anyway, farewell to Sadie's, and best wishes to Al Ridley. Sorry to everyone that missed out on visiting Sadie's while it was open.
