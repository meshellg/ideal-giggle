These go by a few different names, Korean Hot Dogs, gamja hot dogs, ugly dogs and more, but whatever you call them, I want you to know that this Korean street food favourite is available vegan from a couple of places in the city (so far.) I recently ordered a bunch of them from [K Seoul Hotdog](https://kseoulhotdog.com), and they were incredible.

Spotting this as an option was totally a fluke, I was prowling around on a delivery site looking for something to have for dinner, when this vegan Korean hot dog caught my eye. They're eye catching, and automatically look like a more exciting corn dog, but tend to come in non-vegan varieties. Someone also gave me a heads up that they also offer a vegan option at [Chung Chun Rice Hot Dog](https://chungchunricedog.ca), but I have yet to try it.

We got noodle, onion, jalapeño, potato, corn, and a red bean filled one called the Vegan Ang which was my favourite. As a vegan hot dog connoisseur (I do have a five year old,) I’m pretty confident they use the Yves Veggie Cuisine hotdogs, which I'm partial to, when it comes to good no nonsense veggie dogs.

I was also impressed with how well they held up overnight. They're quite large, so it was great to be able to enjoy them the next day without any noticeable loss of texture/flavour. Your abilities may vary but there was no way we'd have been able to finish all of these in one evening. I would definitely try these again another time.

So visit them in Koreatown on Bloor street if you can, they're also available on a few delivery apps. If you do plan on visiting them in person, be advised that they are up a half flight of stairs. They do have a couple tables outside, but not for table service.

If you want to make these at home, [Maangchi's got a great looking recipe for them](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gamja-hotdog), just replace with a veggie dog and you're golden.
