I recently got a copy of In Bibi's Kitchen, and I ran through it to see which recipes were vegan or easily veganizable (replacing milk/eggs). I realized as I was making my list that it might be helpful to other people considering the book.

I think it's a beautiful cookbook whether you're vegan or not - but reading through it, I also found it fairly vegan friendly, and it's also full of rich stories of countries and places and individuals (especially grandma's) that live in or with heritage from 8 countries in Africa.

The book was enjoyable to read through without having made anything yet - the discussions of foodways in Africa - in the way that it explores the intersection of food in culture, traditions, and history. They look at spice ways and historical colonizer impacts and influences and more.

On to the recipes! If it's listed below, it's vegan by default or with only small modifications as indicated.

## Chapter One - Eritrea

- Kicha (Eritrean flatbread)
- Zebhi Hamli (Stewed Spinach)
- Shiro (ground chickpea stew)
- Shahan Ful (Mashed Lima's with Onions, Tomatoes, and Chiles)
- Buna (Eritrean coffee, with description of coffee ceremony)

## Chapter Two - Somalia

- Xawaash Spice Mix (pronounced HA-wash)
- Sabaayad (somali flatbreads) - this one has whole milk in it, but I would like to try making the recipe with some higher fat soy milk or coconut milk
- Somali Cilantro and Green Chile Pepper Sauce
- Canjeero (Sourdough Pancakes)
- Bariis (Basmati Rice Pilaf with Raisins)
- Shaah Cadays (Somali Spiced Tea with Milk) - this has milk, but I believe would be easy enough to make with a plant based milk.

## Chapter Three - Kenya

- Kachumbari (Tomato and Onion Salads)
- Mango Chili Sauce
- Sauteed Cabbage
- Ma Penny's Mukimo (Mashed green split peas, corn, and potatoes) - this calls for butter, but you know what to do.
- Sukuma Wiki (greens with tomatoes)
- Ma Wambui's Mikimo with Onions and Greens
- Kunde (Black-eyed Peas and Tomatoes in Peanut Sauce)
- Basboosa (semolina cake) - this one calls for eggs and buttermilk, but I know we can do it with some egg replacer and some soymilk+lemonjuice
- Fresh Carrot Drink

## Chapter Four - Tanzania

- Ndizi Kaanga (fried Plantains) - this calls for butter or ghee, but you know.
- Zanzibar Pilau
- Quick Stewed Eggplant with Coconut
- Date Bread (calls for eggs and butter)
- Mango Juice
- Kaimati (Crispy Coconut Dumplings in Cardamom Syrup)

## Chapter Five - Mozambique

## Chapter Seven - Madagascar

- Carrot Salad with Vinaigrette
- Tsaramaso Malagasy (Traditional malagasy white beans)
- Lasary Legioma (Tomato Relish)
- Mofo Akondro (Banana Fritters)
- Ginger Spritz (this is a drink that calls for honey, but would be easily replaced with agave or maple syrup, or simple syrup or apple honey, you get it.)

## Chapter Eight - Comoros

- Sweet Pea Soup with Coconut and Ginger
- Ambrevades au Curry (Curried Pigeon Peas)
- Sweet Vermicelli Noodles with Cardamom and Butter - yes, you see that butter in the title, but it's so easy to replace it with some margarine or some vegan butter.
- Watermelon Juice with Lime Ginger and Mint.

As you can see, In Bibi's Kitchen offers lots of options for vegans, including several main dishes, desserts, and sides. I am looking forward to trying all of these. If and when I do, I'll update this post.
