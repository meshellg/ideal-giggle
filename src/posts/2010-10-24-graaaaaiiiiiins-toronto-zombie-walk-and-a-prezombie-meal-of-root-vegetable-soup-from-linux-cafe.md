Yesterday was a great day to be near Christie Pits park. The streets were full of Zombies, and if I had the wherewithal to have planned ahead, I would have dressed up in my best vegan zombie gear and shuffled along the street in search for "graaaaaains". Unfortunately I didn't have the wherewithal or the inclination, so I went and snapped a few photos instead.

This was one of the sights right at Christie Pits park.

But I have to say my favourite ensemble was the Star Trek Zombies

Before the zombie festivities I visited the Linux Caffe for a bite to eat. They are part of the Indie Coffee Passport thing so I skipped the coffee (and ps. they charge an extra 50 cents for soymilk, bleh) and just ordered a root vegetable soup they had marked as vegan. It normally comes with toast, but when I asked, the server said he didn't think the bread was vegan, so I skipped it. And he kindly gave me a little bit of a discount since I wasn't having the bread.

The first bite of soup was weird, and not what I was expecting, but by the end of it I was really enjoying it. I'd probably order it again.

I wish this place had vegan baked goods from somewhere other than OMG Baked Goodness (which I cannot support for a variety of reasons), so I'll be skipping that until they have alternate options, but I like that they have free wifi, and it's stocked with nerdy computer books if you're so inclined (which I am, but just having the wifi was good enough for me.)
