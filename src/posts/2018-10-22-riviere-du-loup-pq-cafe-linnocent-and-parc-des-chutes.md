After [Quebec City](http://meshell.ca/blog/quebec-city-pq-wandering-history-les-gourmandes-louca/), we made a pit stop in Rivière-du-Loup - just to grab lunch and stretch our legs for the next part of our trip. Luckily, Café L'Innocent was there for us. It's a funky artsy space with indoor and outdoor seating - and it's conveniently located within a 10 minute walking distance of Parc des Chutes - a beautiful park with a waterfall (that is also a hydroelectric generator) and hiking trails for varying abilities.

We started our visit at the cafe and ordered some of their vegan things, they have things labelled on the menu as to what is or can be made vegan, and ordering was straightforward and our server was very helpful. JC went in before us to ask about vegan options and the server was enthusiastic and friendly about it, which made us extra happy to stay.

JC really wanted poutine before we, voila, they had a vegan one. It was a different take on poutine, and had [VegNature](https://www.vegnature.com/) chèvre slices on top (which is based in Quebec city) and JC liked it. I was too focused on my falafel burger to steal too much of his food.

I was really feeling the falafel burger, and the kiddo really like the hummus and falafel plate. We had our fill of the delicious food, and then went for a walk over to the nearby Park.

We went back to Rivière-du-Loup on the way back as well, and visited the same park - it's just such a lush green and lovely spot to take a break or walk around. Peeking into the window at the generating station was pretty cool too, if you're there for a while, or just passing through, these two spots were great.
