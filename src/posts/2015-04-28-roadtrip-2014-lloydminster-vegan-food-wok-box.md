I'm still writing about our [Summer Roadtrip 2014](http://meshell.ca/blog/category/roadtrip-2014/) adventure when we ate our way through the USA and Canada. After one final morning in Saskatoon, we drove on towards Edmonton.

On Highway 16/aka Yellowhead, the natural midway point between Saskatoon and Edmonton has always been Lloydminster, which is a city that exists in both Saskatchewan and Alberta, it's a decent place to fill up on gasoline, and grab a bite to eat.![Alberta Saskatchewan Border](images/17010371607_ce4e80cd4e_z.jpg)

The weird thing about Lloydminster is that the Alberta-Saskatchewan border is delineated in the middle of the city, by a series of huge metal posts all the way down the street.

Vegan options beyond going to a grocery store or [Nutter's Market](http://nutters.com/store-locations-2/alberta/lloydminster-ab/) are minimal, and in years past I was limited to wendy's baked potatoes drenched in hot sauce, potato related things, or a smoothie, but on this visit I spotted a Wok Box and we rejoiced - especially since it would be the first time JC had ever visited the wonders of Wok Box.

Wok Box does exist almost all over Canada (including [a few locations in Ontario](http://www.wokbox.ca/province/ontario) - Oshawa and London), but it's still mainly a west-west central thing. But they've been a vegan-friendly spot since the beginning, and [they've been transparent about allergies and veg food both on their website](http://www.wokbox.ca/allergy-nutrition), and with posters up at every location.

I'm all about the Extra Spicy Dan Dan, with tofu, on udon noodles, and I get the same thing, every time. Be it in Lloydminster, or by gate 58 at the [Edmonton International Airport - Post security Domestic-International area](https://www.flickr.com/photos/prairiev/14557056531/in/photolist-obmHKi-odr7ce).

Every time: Dan Dan. Tofu. Udon Noodles. I might be a creature of habit.

My impression of the location in Lloydminster was really positive. They seemed to be very organized, customer service was fast and friendly, and best of all - they had both vegan food AND free wifi, and for a couple of nerds like us on a roadtrip, some food and wifi time was welcome after a couple of hours of driving.

In a few hours we would be in Edmonton which promised more sightseeing, friends, family, and delicious vegan food. Until next time...
