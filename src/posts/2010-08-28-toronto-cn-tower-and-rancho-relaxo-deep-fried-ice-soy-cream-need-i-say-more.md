Last time I was in Toronto I didn't go up to the CN Tower, and I felt I was missing out on an important (/tounge-in-cheek) tourist experience. So I finally went up and it was awesome. I love heights, and the views were incredible. I'm glad I finally went up. That makes the third high place I've been to, for the first time, on the second visit to a city in a year. Seattle Space Needle, Stratosphere in Las Vegas, and now the CN Tower in Toronto. It's been a (somewhat) good year for that sort of thing.

On the way home I was caught in a freak downpour. I've decided that for the remainder of my time in Toronto (however long that is) I'm going to carry around an umbrella in my purse just in case. No more getting soaked to the bone! Edmonton has an unpredictable climate, but Toronto has also been a mixed bag.

We went to [Rancho Relaxo](http://www.ranchorelaxo.biz/) (300 College Street, Toronto) for dinner, Vegan Chimichangas, they were good, a bit meatier than I like, but I'm not super fond of fake meat products in the best of times. I'm fairly certain that they used daiya because the cheese was melty.

Then for dessert I tried the deep fried soy ice cream. There was no way of getting a nice picture of it, it doesn't look particularly good when it is visible, and the lighting was terrible (and the photographer, i.e. me, was being lazy). BUT it was remarkably delicious. Vanilla covered in a cornflake like batter, with simple syrup (or maybe even agave syrup) drizzled on top. Trust me on this one, it's worth eating.
