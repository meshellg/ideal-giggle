The folks that have brought us the ever lovely Awai have a low-key plant based cafe brewing up on College - Away Cafe . They've been open for about a month, and it's looking like a great space.

You can sort of see the menu in the picture above, but it's a nice mix of breakfast options, appetizers, soup, salad, and drinks.

We went last week and tried a few things for a late lunch.

I ordered the Porcini mushroom soup with a savoury rosemary scone.

and JC had the empanadas.

Also the soy latte I had was excellent too.

There is a nice atmosphere, and it's full of plants and whimsy. Also there are a couple of literal plant walls that are beautiful (and delicious). There is quite a bit of seating and free wifi.
