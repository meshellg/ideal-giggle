A few months ago we were in Montreal, gallivanting around. I was still pregnant, and we were taking our final vacation as just the two of us. It was nice to be there, and I had amassed a decent list of "To Visit" spots over the year or so since we'd last visited the city. It was March, and there was still a bit of snow on the ground. One of the newer spots on my list was Sophie Sucrée - an all vegan bakery.

We decided to go there for breakfast our second morning, and it was our first experiment with using Car2Go in Montreal (which turned out great, since I was walking around with a heavy 37 week pregnant belly.) JC dropped me off in front of Sophie Sucrée, while he found parking, and I got to soak up the baked goods and the atmosphere of the space. If you're feeling a bit more mobile than I was when we were visiting, you can catch the Metro to Station Sherbrooke. It's only a 7-8 minute walk to the bakery.

There are a few tables inside, but it's more of a small cozy space with most of the focus on baked goods. The case had several delicious looking cupcakes, pastries, pies, and cakes, to choose from, so we tried a little bit of everything.

We decided to follow the advice of the sandwich board outside inviting us to try the spinach and feta puff pastry (feuilleté aux epinards et au fromage feta) which was great advice. It was flaky and delicious with a rich savoury spinach and feta filling.

We also tried a cinnamon bun, which as you might expect, was excellent as well.

Overall, definitely a great spot to visit. Luckily, if you can't make it to the bakery, they also provide baked goods to a bunch of other places around the city, including Cafe Venosa, a vegan cat cafe that we'd be visiting later that same day.

The nice thing about taking a bunch of extra treats home with me that day was having a box of pastries to choose from the next morning when Simon’s kicks woke me up at 4am.

**Accessibility:** There is one large step to enter the bakery. The restrooms needs a key but are on the same floor, through a door, and down the hall, but do not have a wide door frame.
