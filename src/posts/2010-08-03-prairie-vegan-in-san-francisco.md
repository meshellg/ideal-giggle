I have one more stop before I get back to Edmonton. I’m on my way to San Francisco, and as usual, I’m trying to plan out the visit in advance. But unlike usual, I've failed the planning process, and am doing it on the plane, on the way (yes, that's right, I'm up in the air on a plane right this second). This trip will be more for sightseeing than for eating, probably similar to my trip to New York in 2008 (two restaurants, twelve “places of interest”) but I’ll have more time.  

**Some food places I really want to check out are:**  
[Millennium Restaurant](http://www.millenniumrestaurant.com/) (580 Geary Street, San Francisco, CA, 415-345-3900)  
One of the things I’m really excited to try is Millennium’s Frugal Foodie Menu (with the optional wine pairing.) They offer a three course prix fixe meal for $39/person ($12 for wine) Sunday thru Wednesday.  

Another one that sounds wonderful is [Souley Vegan](http://souleyvegan.com/) in Oakland, California. It’s a vegan soul food place, with generous portion sizes and comes highly recommended, so how can I pass up the opportunity. (Souley Vegan, 301 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607-3804, (510) 922-1615)  

There is a special event on Wednesdays and Thursdays at [La Victoria Bakery](http://www/lavictoriabakery.com) (2937 24th street, San Francisco) called Soul Cucina, where they have a variety of fresh new vegan items to choose from.  
When there are lots of options it’s hard to decide where to go, so I’ve been modifying and cutting down on places to visit as time has passed.  

[Herbivore](http://www.herbivorerestaurant.com/index.html) (983 Valencia Street), San Fransisco for breakfast (which happens between 9am-2pm). All of the options look delicious, I'll have a hard time deciding when I get there.  

[Weird Fish](http://weirdfishsf.com/) (on 2193 Mission St) open after 5:30pm for dinner. The Buffalo Gals were highly recommended.  

**Non Food Stuff**  
The one that I’ve been certain of since the beginning of my planning was the [San Francisco Museum Of Modern Art](http://www.sfmoma.org/). How can I pass up the opportunity to walk through the halls of the other MOMA and check out some of the greatest works of modern art ever created? The short answer is, I can’t.  I’ll just have to keep in mind that it’s free on the first Tuesday of the Month, and stay away (I imagine it's busy). The building itself is enough to warrant a visit, but then to see works by Eva Hesse, Ellsworth Kelly and Andy Warhol, in person, well, that’s just impossible. Conveniently it’ll be near my hostel.  

I’m planning to spend a day in Golden Gate Park, starting off at the [Japanese Tea Garden](http://japaneseteagardensf.com/), heading to the [San Francisco Botanical Gardens](http://www.sfbotanicalgarden.org/), the [de Young museum](http://www.famsf.org/), and maybe [The California Academy of Sciences](http://www.calacademy.org/). I’m extremely excited about the de Young museum. On Sunday’s the park is closed to traffic, so it might be a good day to rent a bike. And there are [free tours](http://sfpt.org/) of the park done by volunteers.  

[The Exploratorium](http://www.blogger.com/www.exploratorium.edu) is free on the first Wednesday of the month. (E) 3601 Lyon St at Marina Blvd. open 10am – 5pm (Tuesday- Sunday)  

**Nice views**  
Sutro Heights Park, Baker beach, [Coit Tower](http://coittower.org/) (10am – 6pm), And it seems no trip to San Francisco is complete without walking or [biking](http://www.blazingsaddles.com/) across the Golden Gate Bridge (or do a [self guided bike tour](http://www.blazingsaddles.com/maps-and-rides/san-francisco-self-guided-tours.aspx)).  

**Performances**  
[Survival Research lab](http://www.srl.org/) performances.  
[Audium](http://audium.org/) – A Sound Sculpture/Performance. Adm.1616 Bush St. @ Franklin, Friday & Saturdays 8:30pm 15$  

That's all for now, but I'm sure I'll have more to report once I get on the ground and get a bit of a feel for the place.
