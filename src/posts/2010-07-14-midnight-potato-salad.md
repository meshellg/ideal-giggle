I couldn't get to sleep last night after sleeping for most of the afternoon (working a night shift really messes with the sleep schedule) so it seemed like the perfect time to use up a few potatoes and make a potato salad. I love potato salad because it's one of the easiest things to make. You can combine such a variety of ingredients and end up with something delicious and satisfying.  

I used up some (okay, all) of my spicy (red jalapeño stuffed) Fiesta Olives from the Alberta Avenue Farmers Market, a sprig of lovage from the Edmonton City Market and a couple of items from a local farm (2 scallions, 2lbs white potatoes, half a zucchini and a few sprigs of parsley, ) 3 pickles and poured in 2 TBSP of Braggs apple cider vinegar, 3 TBSP extra virgin olive oil and a touch of sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.  

There are a lot of recipes that call for mayonnaise or sour cream, but I tend to take it easy on those when I'm making this salad. When I want to make something rich and creamy, I end up using about a cup of veganaise, especially when I'm making something for omnivores, but this potato salad is nice and light, and my family really enjoyed it.
