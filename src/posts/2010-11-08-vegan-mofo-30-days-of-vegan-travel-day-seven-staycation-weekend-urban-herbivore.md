This weekend was a nice little break, today it's back to the grindstone.  

I finally tried a chimichuri sandwich at Urban Herbivore, and after all that wait, it was... okay. The moment the sad little sandwich was passed over to me in the paper box, I felt sad that I didn't get a quinoa bowl. Sure it was tasty enough, but it felt oddly like fast food, without the requisite smile.

My lunch companion and I were talking about the many uses of pumpkin. It's one of my favourite autumn veggies, especially when it's spiced. I suggested some pie alternative pumpkin dishes, savory options like pumpkin curry or salted roasted pumpkin and some that were sweet but not pie related (pumpkin cinnamon buns, pumpkin cheesecake, pumpkin sorbetto). After all of this pumpkin talk it seemed perfect that when I turned around, I saw a piece of gluten free pumpkin pie in the glass case. My mouth was primed for pumpkin, so I had to order it, and I was not disappointed. Very delicious, and I loved the crust.  


My only question... does Urban Herbivore have plates? If so... I sure wish I got one.
