This weekend we finally checked out Brunch at Cosmic Treats. I haven't been in there since they opened, but JC brought me a few of their baked goods shortly after they opened. and I liked 'em. But we decided to actually go and eat inside since they are so much more than a candy and ice cream shop.

Kensington showed its friendly face to me in the street with a random stranger bullying me on the sidewalk. After that, I was ready to just go home and stay home for the day or week. But instead we walked into to Wanda's Pie in the Sky and drank soy lattes while I pretended to read books for about two hours before Cosmic Treats opened for brunch.

Cosmic Treats opens at 11:30 am, and we stood there like hungry cats in the rain (except there was no rain, and you should really [keep your cats indoors at all times anyway](http://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/12-reasons-to-keep-your-cat-indoors/)) until a line up of other hungry people formed behind us. I considered scratching at the door, but resisted. They let us sit a bit sooner than they were ready, and the restaurant filled up steadily after the door opened. But frankly, I liked them a lot and I think they could be busier.[![Cosmic Treats - Hot Chocolate with Marshmallow](images/22490530599_f12640d758_z.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/prairiev/22490530599/in/dateposted-public/ "Cosmic Treats - Hot Chocolate with Marshmallow")

We started with a couple of hot chocolates with marshmallows and the Sweet Chili Heat Doritos encrusted fried tofu. Which was delicious as you might expect. It came with a bbq sauce.

I ordered the All Day Breakfast, which comes with potatoes, tofu scramble, and your choice of cornmeal waffles or pancakes.  I really really liked the waffles which came with a small but ample jug of maple syrup. I like my potatoes more roasted or mushy than what I received, and the scramble could have been more scrambled, but the seasoning was really great.

 JC got the Chicken Pot Pie, and it seemed crumbly and delicious, but I only stole a few bites because I was too busy trying to finish my own massive plate.

Finally, while we didn't finish our breakfast - I still wanted dessert, so we shared a piece of the Brookie. Yes, that's a delightful portmanteau of Brownie and Cookie. It was amazing, as you might expect.

Service was friendly, helpful, and the interior is really fun. I would recommend checking it out, especially if you haven't yet done so.
