We bought the [Tofurky Ham-Style Roast](http://www.tofurky.com/what-we-make/holiday/ham-roast/) this weekend for the first time (from the refrigerated section at Metro in Toronto, but it's available at Whole Foods and Sobey's locations too) And since I couldn't find much information about it online, I wanted to share what we thought. This is the first year it's been available in Canada, so the moment I heard about it, I wanted to try it.

It's a small seitan based ham that looks visually appealing, and comes with a sweet and tangy beer glaze featuring [Hopworks Urban Brewery](http://hopworksbeer.com/) beer from Oregon. It's full of flavour and has a vaguely ham-like flavour. If you are familiar with Tofurky roasts, the texture is quite similar - and personally, I liked it, and it complemented our meal quite nicely.

It's not huge, but could serve 3-4 people with a nice variety of sides and/or some stuffing.

I did not follow the preparation instructions on the box - we were making a very late dinner, and I didn't feel like baking it for over an hour, so your experience may vary. But if you wanted to save some time and make it in the Instant Pot like I did, I mostly followed the box instructions on prep - half a cup of water, and based my timing on [JL's Vegan Roast post here](https://jlgoesvegan.com/vegan-holiday-roast-in-the-pressure-cooker/). She has some great ideas for making more things simultaneously too.

I thought it was great that they had it in the refrigerated section this year, since normally you have to do more planning ahead to make a Tofurky holiday roast or ham roast - but both were ready to bake.

**Instant Pot Instructions** Put half a cup of water in the instant pot, add roast, put on high pressure for 9 minutes, and let the pressure release naturally.

Poured glaze on top of the roast and brought to pressure for 4 minutes. This will result in a tender juicy roast vs a more caramelized glaze, but I really liked the result. The remaining glaze and water mixture at the bottom of the instant pot made for a fantastic quick gravy too.

Hope you find this helpful, and let me know what you think of this product if you try it!
