This is my fourth year going to [Recipe for Change](http://foodshare.net/recipeforchange/) (see my pictures from [2012](http://meshell.ca/recipe-for-change-foodshare-a-night-in-pictures/), [2013](http://meshell.ca/recipe-for-change-2013-an-evening-in-pictures/), [2014](http://meshell.ca/recipe-for-change-2014-food-and-photos/), and now 2016) and it's not the same as it once was, especially in terms of vegan options, but it was still a great time as always. And of course, the event admission tickets support a great organization - FoodShare Toronto, which does fantastic food literacy work in Toronto, amongst so many other things, like the [Good Food Box](http://foodshare.net/program/goodfoodbox/), the [Mobile Good Food Market](http://foodshare.net/program/mobile/), [Food literacy resources for educators](http://foodshare.net/program/educator/), and so much more.

I went with my mom this year, since she was visiting from out of town, and we had a great time.

## The vegan options were from a few different places:

**My Little Dumplings - Eggplant, fresh Harissa and Za’atar dumplings**

My Little Dumplings is a Recipe for Change favourite - I'm pretty sure he's always had a vegan options, and it's always been delicious. Chef Bashir Munye has been cooking dumplings up around the city at various farmers markets (including Evergreen Brickworks) - and recently opened a location in Leslieville at 1372 Queen Street East (@ Greenwood) - so check them out sometime. Open Thursday and Friday at 11am-7pm

**Good Earth Food and Wine - Ancho & lime tempeh** [![Good Earth Food and Wine - Ancho & lime tempeh](images/25449573881_794e452cf5_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/prairiev/25449573881/in/album-72157664804155869/ "Good Earth Food and Wine - Ancho & lime tempeh")

This was great but they were definitely more enthusiastic about their meaty options. Which is too bad, because the tempeh with the sauce was exceptional. They had a giant bowl of extra spicy sauce available on the side which kicked it up an extra few notches. I went back for thirds, but I bet people would have been more excited about them if they'd been ready to go.

**Bendale Business and Technical Institute - Punjabi bhurtha and black channa curry** (without the rice Pilau which unfortunately had butter in it.)

**King Edward Hotel Spiced ChickPea Flatbread with Roasted Squash, Eggplant Caviar & Coriander Cress (Vegan)** [![King Edward Hotel Spiced ChickPea Flatbread with Roasted Squash, Eggplant Caviar & Coriander Cress](images/25246534360_a8abf40710_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/prairiev/25246534360/in/album-72157664804155869/ "King Edward Hotel Spiced ChickPea Flatbread with Roasted Squash, Eggplant Caviar & Coriander Cress")

I had a great conversation with the chef at the King Edward Hotel - he told me that they do vegan things for special events, and do have some options on menu - and that his efforts creating interesting vegan food have been encouraged by the fact that his teenage son is vegan. The Chef also said something I've been saying for years - making incredible tasting plant-based food can take serious skill - and it can also be fun for people that have dedicated their lives and careers to making beautiful and delicious food.

**_Empower Tea_**

EmpowerT is a crisp clean cold green tea layered with notes of botanicals with no added sugar/sweeteners. Paired with Earl Grey tea (I skipped the marshmallows)  but went back for thirds or fourths of this tea. It is entirely unsweetened, which I like and had a nice flavour profile. They're working on making it into retail in the next few months, so maybe you'll see if around town sometime.

**Jesus Gomez - FoodShare Kitchen - Meatless pin roll burrito bites with fiesta corn salsa (vegan)** [![Jesus Gomez - FoodShare Kitchen - Meatless pin roll burrito bites with fiesta corn salsa (vegan)](images/25420467092_b6ca52467b_c.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/prairiev/25420467092/in/album-72157664804155869/ "Jesus Gomez - FoodShare Kitchen - Meatless pin roll burrito bites with fiesta corn salsa (vegan)")

The corn salsa was delicious - and Chef Gomez was nice enough to let me take a jar of it home with me. Part of me wants to open it immediately, and part of me wants to save it indefinitely.

**Cruda Cafe - Mini pumpkin tarts and mini nanaimo bars (and more)**

![Recipe for Change 2016](images/Recipe-for-Change-2016.jpg)

Cruda Cafe was a surprise favourite this year. There were four different desserts to enjoy, and all of them were beautiful - I also enjoyed people's surprise at finding out they were vegan as I was wandering around.

Overall it was another great event with a lot of good energy and intention - FoodShare does a lot of great work in the city, so it's always nice to hear a bit more about their programming from Director Debbie Fields, and celebrate their work every year. **Bonus: Priority Seating Tables**

I also really appreciated the priority seating tables this time around. I know they had them a year or so ago - but I never needed them as much as I did this time. (I look a lot like the lady in the middle of the card right now.)
