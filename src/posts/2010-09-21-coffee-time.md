A cafe that's been getting a lot of buzz lately is [Snakes and Lattes](http://www.snakesandlattes.com/), the boardgame cafe, on Bloor. I wanted to check it out to see what all the fuss was about and find out if they had anything for me to eat. Well. They don't. If you're vegan, don't go there if your hungry because you'll leave even hungrier. But at least they have soy milk (which they charge an extra 50 cents for) and will make you a latte, though the one I had today was pretty awful. Luckily, I wasn't there for the coffee.

On the bright side, the selection of games is amazing. I was thrilled to see over twenty different varieties of Monopoly (including Catopoly,) the Settlers of Catan (which a friend of mine wants me to try playing, and old favourites like Payday, Guess Who, Sorry, and Mastermind. The one that was missing was 10,000 Questions. I can't even find that one online though. I probably have the name wrong.  

We played a brief game of "Being Sneaky", an awesome game of Jenga, and a weird paper based game of Tetris. There is something so awesome about having at least five other people yell JENGA!!! when the tower topples over.  

The Linux Cafe is in the same area, so it was time to check that one out too. They have a pretty great vegan item selection, on the day I went there was a Quinoa Salad, they have vegan cupcakes from OMG Baked Goodness (which for personal reasons I will no longer support,) and other vegan snacks. I picked up some Happiness (I think that's what it was called) and it was this chewy caramel like thing with nuts, peanut butter and a bit of chocolate brownie all mixed together. Total yum.
