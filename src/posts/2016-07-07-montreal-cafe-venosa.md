**Update: June 14, 2017: Sadly, [Cafe Venosa has announced they are closed and declaring bankruptcy](https://www.facebook.com/cafevenosamontreal/photos/a.487881761365714.1073741828.441160246037866/842977439189476/?type=3&theater).**

So far, I've written about our most recent visit to [Aux Vivres](http://meshell.ca/blog/montreal-2016-aux-vivres/) and [Sophie Sucrée](http://meshell.ca/blog/montreal-sophie-sucree/), but Café Venosa has been on my list since they first appeared. A few months ago JC and I were in Montreal, wandering around. I was still pregnant and we were taking our final vacation as just the two of us. It was nice to visit and knock off a few places on my "To Visit" list. It was March, and there was still a bit of snow on the ground.

One of those stops was Cafe Venosa (of course) since it combines a few of my favourite things - vegan food, coffee, and cats. (and also wifi.)

We walked in, and to the right there was a board with some of the adoptable cats. We saw a few cats wandering around, a case of sweet treats from a couple of vegan bakeries, and friendly staff waiting to take our order. They told us to take a seat and they'd be right by to grab our order.

We started out with some hot drinks - I ordered a hot chocolate, JC got a soy latte. Then I got a soy latte, and JC got a hot chocolate. Then we alternated for the rest of our visit and confused everyone including ourselves.

They brought me this beauty of a hot chocolate. It was as good as it looked! Though I'm not going to lie - I wish it looked like a cat (they do that there with the lattes sometimes.)

It was fun to just hang out with cats and hot drinks, and soak in the space. It was wide and open, and had a bunch of kitties running around, snoozing on chairs, climbing on tables (including ours), and sitting on tall scratching posts.

The fellow above (Kiyoshi) just hung out on the chair beside us right after a pair of humans left. He reminded me of a cat (Webster) I once knew at Street Cat Rescue in Saskatoon, both in appearance and the general wise vibe I got from him.

This fellow (Tarquin) ran around stealing straws from as many people as possible. He made sure to take over a table beside us where a couple was trying to play the Cthulhu edition of Munchkin.

We did eat while at Cafe Venosa - and shared a Pizza Venosa along with a couple of bowls of soup. The Pizza Venosa, has sauce, vegan cheese, onions, basil, tomatoes, and some pumpkin seeds. It came out on flat bread which wasn't what I expected when I ordered pizza, but this was quite delicious either way.

Conveniently, Cafe Venosa also has vegan donuts available for those of us with a sweet tooth. They also have a variety of baked goods from Sophie Sucree available. We'd been to Sophie Sucree earlier that day, so it seemed to make sense to try the donuts.

Over all, great hang out spot, if you like cats and vegan food you will likely be happy here. They do workshops and events as well.

Just follow the rules of the space to help keep the kitties happy too. xo.
