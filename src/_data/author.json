I try to find intersection points between my love of and skills in technology with causes and organizations that are important to me. Feel free to reach out, I love to help out as time allows.
I've been vegan since the late 90's, and it's been an interesting and exciting journey to watch the cuisine and movement evolve. I am interested in the history of veganism and how we got here.
I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with my partner JC, our 2 cats, and our preschooler son.",
